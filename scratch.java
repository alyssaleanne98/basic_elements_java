// Consider the code below 

// System.out.printf("%6.2f", 597.7231); 
// What will this code print out?
    // The code uses System.out.printf to format and print a floating-point number, 597.7231, with specific formatting.
    // %6.2f: This indicates a floating-point number (f) with a total width of 6 characters, including both the integer and decimal parts. The number will be displayed with two decimal places.
    // The total width is specified as 6 characters.
    // The number has four digits in the integer part (597) and four digits in the decimal part (7231), making a total of eight digits.
    // As the specified width is 6, it means two digits will be displayed before the decimal point and four digits after the decimal point.

    // 2. The scanner class is imported by default 
        // False 
    
    // 3. True or False: The Scanner class has a method called nextString that allows an entire line of string text to be read. False 

    // 4. Consider the code below: 
// DecimalFormat formatter = new DecimalFormat("0.0%");
// double myNum = .314159;
// System.out.println(formatter.format(myNum));

// What will this code print to the console? 
    // 31.4%
